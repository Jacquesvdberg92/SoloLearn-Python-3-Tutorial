# Boolean Logic

# Boolean logic is used to make more complicated conditions for if statements that rely on more than one condition.
# Python's Boolean operators are and, or, and not.
# The and operator takes two arguments, and evaluates as True if, and only if, both of its arguments are True. Otherwise, it evaluates to False. 


print(1 == 1 and 2 == 2)
# True

print(1 == 2 and 2 == 1)
# False

print(1 != 1 and 2 == 2)
# False

print(1 == 2 or 2 == 2)
# True *becasue of OR
