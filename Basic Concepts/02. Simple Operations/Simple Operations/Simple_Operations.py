# Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an asterisk to indicate multiplication and a forward slash to indicate division. 
# Use parentheses to determine which operations are performed first.

# 2 * (3 + 4)
print (2*(3 + 4))

# 10 / 2
print (10/2)

# Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or float, as it is called in programming).

# The minus sign indicates a negative number.
# Operations are performed on negative numbers, just as they are on positive ones. 
print(-7)
print((-7 + 2) * (-4))

# Dividing by zero in Python produces an error, as no answer can be calculated.
print(11/0)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
# File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# In Python, the last line of an error message indicates the error's type.
