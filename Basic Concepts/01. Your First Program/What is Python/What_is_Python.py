# Python is a high-level programming language, with applications in numerous areas, including web programming, scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence.
# It is very popular and used by organizations such as Google, NASA, the CIA, and Disney.
# Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. There is no need to compile your program before executing it.

# Let's start off by creating a short program that displays "Hello world!".
# In Python, we use the print statement to output text: 

print('Hello world!')

# The print statement can also be used to output multiple lines of text.

print('Hello World!')
print('Spam and eggs...')
