# Using an Editor

# So far, we've only used Python with the console, entering and running one line of code at a time.
# Actual programs are created differently; many lines of code are written in a file, and then executed with the Python interpreter.

# In IDLE, this can be done by creating a new file, entering some code, saving the file, and running it. 
# This can be done either with the menus or with the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl-N, Ctrl-S and F5.

# Each line of code in the file is interpreted as though you entered it one line at a time at the console.
