# Functions

# In addition to using pre-defined functions, you can create your own functions by using the def statement.
# Here is an example of a function named my_func. 
# It takes no arguments, and prints "spam" three times. It is defined, and then called. 
# The statements in the function are executed only when the function is called.
def my_func():
   print("spam")
   print("spam")
   print("spam")

my_func()
#spam
#spam
#spam


# Functions

# You must define functions before they are called, 
# in the same way that you must assign variables before using them.
hello()

def hello():
    print("Hello world!")
#NameError: name 'hello' is not defined
